    <p><h3>I'm still learning to code. I came from a background of electrical engineering, so I'm only familiar with
        low-level languages of code. The first type of code that i learned was C++, AND I HATED IT! But some years
        ahead, I discovered the wonders of Python coding. It is so easy and helpful. Once I've learned it, I was able
        to facilitate my life at work.</p></h3>
    <p>First thing I did was a program that automatically filled the work reports at the end of my day! haha </p>
